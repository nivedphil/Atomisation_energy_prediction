# Atomisation_energy_prediction
Predicts the Atomisation energy required for a given molecule provided the molecular features 

The Dataset can be found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kFKAxTViaIMqzFKLFZcpnBClsXLkNwT2/view?usp=sharing
download this file and place it in the same repository as the Jupyter Notebook

The file contains 1277 molecular features of 16242 molecules
Of which the last column "Eat" is the Atomisation energy for the corresponding Molecule
